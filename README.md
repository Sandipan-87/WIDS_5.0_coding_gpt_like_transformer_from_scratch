# WIDS_5.0_coding_gpt_like_transformer

## Week 1 Resources 


[Python in 1 Hour](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqtD5dpn9C8)
or 
You can also do a course on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/python) about python.
(Just a refresher)

(Optional: You can also watch some short videos or documents on learning some python libraries like [Numpy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUT1VHiLmmI),

[Pandas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmEHCJofslg) and [Matplotlib](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAQNHzOcO5A) while we'll mainly focus on pytorch library later on this project)

(We recommend using VS Code or google colab for everything there is no need to use the same code editors as the tutorials)

(Just understand the basics don't need to memorize syntaxes so much)

A simple introduction to neural networks: [watch video 74 and 75](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv9_4yMHFhI&list=PLblh5JKOoLUICTaGLRoHQDuF_7q2GfuJF)

Let's keep this a little lite for the 1st week :)

## Week 2 Resources 

Now that you have an intro to how NNs work, let's deep dive into their specific components in more detail:

[watch videos from 76 to 84](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv9_4yMHFhI&list=PLblh5JKOoLUICTaGLRoHQDuF_7q2GfuJF) (recommended for this wids project)

Additionally, If you want to learn even more beyond this proect timeline:
Here is [The Longer way (The two courses by Stanford and DeepLearning.ai)](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-introduction)

(If you apply for a financial aid on coursera, you can get free certificates for your resume)

If not, you can watch the free versions here:

[Course 2 on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggWLvh484hs&list=PLyoNSC4BT4eVpykPF0Yx8C1Zs50XtD17L)

If you finish early, you can start exploring the tools required to build the transformer: 

[Introduction to Pytorch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OIenNRt2bjg) (Optional for week 2) 

We'd move onto the attention mechanism and working of the decoder-only transformer by the 3rd week.


## Week 3 Resources


[Introduction to PyTorch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OIenNRt2bjg) (Don't stress about syntax too much , Kudos if you already covered this in Week 2!)

**Step 1:** [watch videos 87 and 89](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv9_4yMHFhI&list=PLblh5JKOoLUICTaGLRoHQDuF_7q2GfuJF)

**Step 2:**  [watch video 90](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv9_4yMHFhI&list=PLblh5JKOoLUICTaGLRoHQDuF_7q2GfuJF)

or

If you prefer reading , check out [The Illustrated Transformer](https://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-transformer/)

(Don't try to understand everything word by word but at least learn the major concepts and use the video as a backup if you get stuck)

[PyTorch Tensors in 5 Mins](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/basics/tensorqs_tutorial.html)
(Skim this. Just understand that Tensors are matrices that run on the GPU)

[Attention in Transformers - 3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMlx5fFNoYc)
(Optional but watch this for deep understanding through visualization)
