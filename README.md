## Week 1 Resources 


[Python in 1 Hour](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqtD5dpn9C8)
or 
You can also do a course on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/python) about python.
(Just a refresher)

(Optional: You can also watch some short videos or documents on learning some python libraries like [Numpy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUT1VHiLmmI),

[Pandas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmEHCJofslg) and [Matplotlib](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAQNHzOcO5A) while we'll mainly focus on pytorch library later on this project)

(We recommend using VS Code or google colab for everything there is no need to use the same code editors as the tutorials)

(Just understand the basics don't need to memorize syntaxes so much)

A simple introduction to neural networks: [watch video 74 and 75](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv9_4yMHFhI&list=PLblh5JKOoLUICTaGLRoHQDuF_7q2GfuJF)
